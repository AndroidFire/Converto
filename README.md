#Converto
An app for confused arabic users

If you are not using arabic/english at the same time this is not for you.

Intro :

How many times while you are writing you found that you didn't switch the language, and instead of the "Hello world" you wrote "اثممخ صخقمي" and vice versa.

This is confusing, and makes you annoyed espically when writing a long post or something.

So, we created this simple app "CONVERTO"

Features:

- Convert arabic to english
- Convert english to arabic

Usage :

- Just like excuting a python app, Google it :D
- Wait for an excuteable windows ".exe" soon


This app was intended to be a fun project.
